The uploaded notebook builds a machine learning pipeline to predict the final number of bus seats booked 15 days before the journey date, as part of the RedBus Demand Forecasting Hackathon. It uses three datasets: `train.csv` (with actual seat counts), `test.csv` (for prediction), and `transactions.csv` (containing booking and search history). The pipeline filters transactions where the booking was made exactly 15 days before the journey, and aggregates features like cumulative seat and search counts, source/destination regions, and city tiers. Temporal features such as day of the week, month, weekend flags, and public holiday indicators are also engineered. These features are merged with the training and test data, and a LightGBM regression model is trained to predict final seat counts. The model achieves a validation MAE of \~298, indicating moderate accuracy. Evaluation includes residual analysis and prediction distribution plots. The pipeline is well-structured and can be improved further through feature engineering, better validation, and hyperparameter tuning.
